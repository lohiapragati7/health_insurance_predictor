# Exploratory Data Analysis & Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview: 
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modelling on a structured dataset.  
The goal is to understand the data, uncover patterns and relationships, and build a machine learning model to make predictions.
Used Linear Regression model, to emphasize data understanding and model interpretation.

Objective:
- Performing exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset
- Identifying relationships between features and the target variable
- Building a machine learning model for prediction
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics

---

The EDA process includes:
- Inspecting dataset structure and data types
- Handling missing values
- Checking duplicates
- Analyzing feature distributions
- Studying correlations between variables
- Identifying potential outliers and dropping them
- Label Encoding

Machine Learning Approach: 
- Model Used: Linear Regression   
  Linear Regression is used as a baseline model to establish relationships between independent variables and the target variable.

  1. Feature–target separation
  2. Train–test split
  3. Model training
  4. Prediction on unseen data
  5. Performance evaluation
